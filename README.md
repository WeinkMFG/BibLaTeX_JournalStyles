This repository contains a collection of BibTeX and BibLaTeX formattings for different journals.

# BibTeX styles

## nature.bst

A style compatible with guidelines for *Nature* journals (https://www.nature.com/). It is only suitable for those *Nature*-publications that include article titles and book titles for InCollection in the references. The style requires "\usepackage{natbib}" to work and uses the "\cite{}" command. It is much closer to the current *Nature* style than the style naturemag.bst included in the LaTeX package "nature", which has not been updated in quite a while.
